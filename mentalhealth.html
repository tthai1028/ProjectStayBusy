            <p>Seeking help in times like this should be shameless, but that isnâ€™t reality. We all need to learn to

            Please please please dont wait till its too late, or down play your feelings if your feeling suicial, your not being a burdon<br>

            I'm a 28 year old from socal, who has personally dealt with mental health issues since i was just a kid,
            one of the hardest things to remember for me when im in crisis is that im not alone. With the corona virus,
            these times are unprecedented and i personally have felt levels of loneliness i never thought possible.
            <br>Please know that <b>Your Not Alone</b> and that <b>It's Ok To Ask For Help</b><br>
            Please don't hesitate to reach out to one of the resources above, if you just need someone to talk to please
            feel free to email me directly i will try to get back to
            you as fast as possible.<br> I deal with depression constantly and i know how dark things can get but no
            matter how isolated you are or think you are people care, you matter and the world wouldnt be the same
            without you.<br>
            Please remember that no matter how dark your day/week/month/year seems there is always tomorrow and with it
            brings new opportunity(often times things i would have never imagined.)<br>
